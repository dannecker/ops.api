#
#     config :ops, key: :value
#
# And access this configuration in your application as:
#
#     Application.get_env(:ops, :key)
#
# Or configure a 3rd-party app:
#
#     config :logger, level: :info
#
# Or read environment variables in runtime (!) as:
#
#     :var_name, "${ENV_VAR_NAME}"

# here (which is why it is important to import them last).
